Retail Sales Analysis Using SQL

This is a portfolio project where I analyzed a retail sales dataset using SQL Server.

## üìÅ c:\Users\ASUS\OneDrive\Desktop\SQL project\retail data analytics
Contains weekly sales data across different stores and departments.

##  Skills Used
- Aggregations (`SUM`, `AVG`, `ROUND`)
- Joins and `GROUP BY`
- Window functions (`RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`, `MOVING AVERAGE`)
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Stored Procedures

## Queries
All queries can be found in the `/queries` folder.

##  Highlights
- Total sales by store and month
- Average sales by department
- Moving average of sales over 3 weeks
- Ranking stores based on performance

## Learnings
This project helped me sharpen my logic-building, query optimization, and advanced SQL concepts.
